# interferometry-for-reflection-seismic-exploration
A matlab code for interferometry of passive seismic exploration
                           
1.	The Files in the directory
There are four matlab function in this directory ,they are :
mwigb:  display the seismic data
readsac: read the data to binary from sac format
getsacdata: get the sac data
xg: the entrance of the program, to get the virtual shot gather from the passive seismic data.

2.	Introduction to the xg
1).The xg is the main entrance of the code, generally speaking  ,the passive data are saved day by data , the virtual shot gathers are formed by one data data and save to the disk , if you would like to save after all the passive data like for 10-days, you should add a loop.
2). Stack all the xg formed shot gather , and you will get the final result.

3.	The test data is too big to upload , if you are interested ,please contact us.
